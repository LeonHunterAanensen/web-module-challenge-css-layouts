        <h1>Get to know me!</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Hi! I am Leon Aanensen, someone deeply interested in engineering and different forms of coding! <br>
    My dream is to someday earn enough to be able to help support others in my family while being able <br>
    to live somewhat comfortably myself! currently in my life im going through an amazingly helpful <br>
    coding bootcamp called Bloomtech! Where I can finally see my self acomplishing my dreams in my future!<br>
    </p>
    <h2> A few things about me! </h2>
    <p>
    <p> For starters im pretty introverted, yes I know the classic introverted coder steryotype.</p>
    <p> I have a bad tendency to get dragged into tasks once I start them and lose track of time rather easily.</p>
    <p> I absolutely love D&D, fantasy audio books, and an assortment of video games I am not gonna get into</p>
    <p> Once I do get lost in a task I get rather determined to finish it, and feel like an idiot if I cant</p>
    <p> And for now thats all the important information I can think of!</p>
